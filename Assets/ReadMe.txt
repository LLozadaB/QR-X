This is the QR-X Prototype for the Advanced Game Development Class, Summer 2025, ITCS-4231.
This ReadMe will guide you through most of the stuff I want to tell the professor.

Since the earlier demo video, the menu has not changed that much. Most of what I did was add the Help section, and cut off some menu options so no buttons would lead to the menus completely unloading.

The music tends to be much louder than the rest of the game: If you were to play this yourself, I suggest lowering the music volume in the Options menu. Speaking of, Full Screen and Resolutions still do not work.

Some physics are wonky, specifically when a car rams another car, ESPECIALLY when they ram into each other at the same time. Even so, the ensuing crashes are pretty entertaining.

The menu songs are all derived from Hot Wheels Unleashed 1 & 2, and I'm pretty sure most of them are royalty-free (if not all of them).

The race songs, I had much more trouble deciding what to make for them, so I chose songs from video games that I like. Hopefully that's fine, and I will show credit for those songs (although the songs and sources are all in their file names):

XF Extreme Formula - Oversummer Circuit
XF Extreme Formula - Nomad
Sonic Riders - Splash Canyon
Inertial Drift - Peak City
Sonic Unleashed - Skyscraper Scamper (Day)

Assets I used, all of them from the Unity Asset Store:
Free Low Poly Vehicle (under Miscellaneous Folder)
PROMETEO - Car Controller (under Misc. The version of this controller found in my game is extremely modified from the original).
Unity Particle Pack
ARCADE - FREE Racing Car (under Prefabs > Vehicles)
Gudamore (Prefabs > Vehicles)
FREE Pickup 3d Model (Prefabs > Vehicles)
I6 German - Free Engine Sound Pack (Gazelle Engine)
Skybox Series Free (under Materials)
Simple Gems and Items Ultimate Animated Customizable Pack (under Prefabs > Objects > Misc Objects)
FREE Casual Game SFX Pack (Most menu FSX, countdowns, wreck indicators)
Free Stylized Vehicle (under Prefabs > Objects > Race Objects)

All of the tracks were made by me, along with making the waypoint system, how the laps and positions work, how the nitro and ramming works, the health systems, the vehicle stats, all of the menus, the music manager, the game manager...Basically most of the scripts that aren't the Car Controller, I made. Even then, the Car Controller has been extremely modified. I am exhausted, and I'm hoping this prototype is good. If the in-race music is bad because they're not royalty free or something, then I am sorry: I just didn't really know what free options there were that I thought would fit well. Also, the horrible engine noise the Crusher makes is mine. I'm so sorry it sounds so bad.

Collecting the collectable (there actually is one in each of the three tracks) does not unlock anything...but an AI bot does use a fourth car the player cannot use.

The L key is bound to make one specific AI player wreck. The K key is bound to make the player wreck (it also works as a button to instantly finish the race).

Also, disclaimer, there are a ton of things that I probably did not use stored inside of the game files, but that's because I don't really know what I am allowed to delete without having something else that I AM using just explode because I accidentally deleted something that I shouldn't have.

Anyways I'm gonna go make the video now.
